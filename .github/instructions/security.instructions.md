# Security Implementation Instructions

Use these instructions for authentication, authorization, OAuth integration, token handling, and secret-safe operations.

## Baseline Requirements

1. Validate all request input before business logic execution.
2. Enforce authentication on protected API routes.
3. Enforce per-user ownership checks for persisted and fetched records.
4. Return 404 for non-owned or non-existent private resources when enumeration risk exists.
5. Keep session and auth data in HTTP-only secure cookie and token-safe transport paths.

## OAuth And Token Rules

1. Use OAuth 2.0 code flow with PKCE for provider integrations.
2. Validate provider scopes at setup and fail closed when required scopes are missing.
3. Rotate refresh tokens safely and record refresh failures without leaking credential material.
4. Use short-lived state values for OAuth callbacks and enforce expiration.
5. Apply rate limiting to OAuth callback and token-refresh endpoints to prevent code/state replay abuse.
6. Apply CSRF protection to cookie-authenticated state-changing routes.

## Secret Management Rules

1. Never hardcode secrets, tokens, API keys, or client secrets.
2. Keep secrets in environment variables only.
3. Keep `.env` and `.env.local` out of version control.
4. Keep `.env.example` as placeholders only.

## Logging And Error Rules

1. Never log raw credentials, tokens, authorization headers, or password fields.
2. Redact sensitive values in structured logs and error paths.
3. Keep production errors actionable without exposing internals.

## Required Env Variables

> Replace this list with your project's actual env variables after running BOOTSTRAP.prompt.md.
> Add a placeholder to `.env.example` for every new secret introduced.

Common variables for auth/OAuth features:
- `JWT_SECRET` — signs access tokens.
- `DATABASE_URL` — database connection string.
- `FRONTEND_URL` — used for CORS and OAuth callback.
- `SESSION_EXPIRES_IN` — token lifetime.

When introducing new auth providers or secrets, add a placeholder to `.env.example` in the same change.

## SAST Coordination

These rules are **additive** to SAST tooling (Snyk, Semgrep, CodeQL, etc.) — not a replacement. Never disable existing SAST to adopt this framework. SAST findings at HIGH or CRITICAL severity are treated as Guardian-level findings in council reviews and cannot be downgraded by other perspectives.

## Client-Side Security Rules

1. Never store access tokens, session tokens, or sensitive credentials in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` — use HTTP-only secure cookies or in-memory state only.
2. Sanitize all user-supplied content before inserting into the DOM. Never use `innerHTML`, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or `eval()` with user-supplied strings without explicit sanitization.
3. Apply Content Security Policy headers that restrict inline script execution. Reference the CSP header requirements in the Infrastructure Security Rules section.
4. Validate that third-party scripts are loaded from known, pinned CDN URLs and that Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes are included where supported.
5. Never log authentication tokens, session identifiers, or sensitive form field values in the browser console.
6. All client-side validation is defense-in-depth only — every input must also be validated server-side. Client-only validation is not a security control.
7. OAuth tokens received by the frontend must be forwarded to the backend immediately and never persisted in client storage.

## Infrastructure Security Rules

1. {{CONTAINER_RUNTIME}} images must use specific version tags, not `:latest`.
2. Containers must run as non-root users for application services.
3. {{REVERSE_PROXY}} configuration must include security headers: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `Referrer-Policy`.
4. TLS certificates must not be committed to source control — `certs/` must be gitignored.
5. {{CONTAINER_RUNTIME}} Compose must not expose database ports to the host unless explicitly required for development.
6. Health check endpoints must not expose internal system details beyond status and timestamp.

## Container Service Rules

1. Every service in `{{CONTAINER_COMPOSE_FILE}}` must have a health check that verifies actual service readiness (not just process startup).
2. Set `restart: unless-stopped` for all long-running services.
3. Use `depends_on` with `condition: service_healthy` for services that require another service to be ready before starting.
4. Set resource limits (CPU and memory) for production-targeted configurations.
5. No secrets in Dockerfiles, Compose files, or reverse proxy configuration — use environment variables only.
6. Non-root `USER` directive required in custom Dockerfiles for application services.
